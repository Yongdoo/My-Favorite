<p>my first memory of popsong was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NsO25CPugkU" target="_blank"title="Youtube">Maximilian Hecker's Summer days in bloom</a></p>
<p>I'm not a Maniac for popsongs but I picked it and still, I don't know why</p>
<p>Maybe I was hipster. So, I don't search for Famous songs of Korea. or Maybe My environment made me so. <br> My parents and sisters was sincere Cristian. They don't frequently listen to K pops.</p>
